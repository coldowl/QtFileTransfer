# QtFileTransfer

## 📚 Overview 

The project includes a file client and a file server. The client and server communicate using either TCP or UDP protocols. The server shares a directory, allowing clients to connect, preview the directory in real-time, upload files to the directory, and download files from the directory. The project supports file resumption and integrity checking. 

## ✨ Features 

1. **Real-time Directory Preview:** Clients can see the server's shared directory in real-time. 
2. **File Upload:** Clients can upload files from their local machine to the server's directory. 
3. **File Download:** Clients can download files from the server's directory. 
4. **Resumable Transfers:** Supports resuming interrupted file uploads and downloads. 
5. **File Integrity Checking:** Ensures the uploaded and downloaded files are intact and uncorrupted.
